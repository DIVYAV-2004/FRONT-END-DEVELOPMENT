<h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

<p>Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the age-old adage,
“If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” can be a two-way street.

Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers internally, 
but most don’t.</p>

<p>And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy 
(that we slaved over) into an ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.
In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, 
we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a fighting chance
to produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.</p>

Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page,
 you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted.
 What’s their pain?
 What’s in it for them?
 Where are they in their buying process?
 And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your solution?</p>
 The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and 
 write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
